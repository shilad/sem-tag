sem-tag
=======
An API for implementing a tagging system based on sematic relatedness and the wikAPIdia library. Specifically we:
* Provide an elegant tagging structure of User, Item, TagApp, and Concept.
* Map an applied tag (TagApp) to a concept, by default a Wikipedia page.
* Support alternative, non-Wikipedia-based concepts.
* Provide efficient methods for measuring similarity between Items, TagApps, and Concepts.
* Provide efficient methods for finding Items, TagApps, and Concepts most similar to a specified one.
* Implement our own minimal, self-contained H2 database
* Planned: Multilingual support

This API is meant to be used for anyone wishing to implement a versatile tagging system on their website or application.
